Fern YT Showcase Fanpage

---

Overview üñ•Ô∏è

This is a fan-made multi-page website created to showcase my HTML and CSS skills. It expands on a previous version of this project that was built with pure HTML and inline styles, by introducing an external stylesheet and modern CSS techniques.

The fanpage highlights the YouTube channel Fern TV and includes information about the channel, its creators, recent videos, and related content.
